## **Title** :
The Influence of Large Language Models on Natural Language Understanding

## **Discription**:

This project explores how large language models (LLMs), powerful computer programs like OpenAI's GPT series and Google's BERT, are changing the way computers understand human language. These programs excel at understanding the context of words, learning from different tasks, and generating new text. We'll dive into how these advanced programs improve language understanding, what challenges they might present, and where they're headed in the future. By examining these aspects closely, we can better understand how LLMs are advancing language comprehension and what lies ahead for them.
